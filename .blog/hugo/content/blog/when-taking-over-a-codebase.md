title: When taking over a codebase
published: 2020-05-18
draft: true
---

- how to behave when taking over a codebase from others
- a codebase is a product of the environment it was developed in
- but the codebase is also a snapshot
- its easy to criticize what others have developed and left behind, but maybe there is a reason for the state it is in
- be positive and take the codebase in a new direction
- but also be aware that whatever you leave behind someone else could criticize your work as well

...include examples of criticism and refactorings (proper and pointless -> same but different!)
