      <description>This is the first post in a series about how to implement the tactical elements of Domain-Drive Design. There will be examples written i C# but they can easily be translated to other languages.
Background I just want to tell about my motivation behind writing this series. I&amp;rsquo;m sure at this time that you are reading this, you will be able to find many other articles (and/or series) about the same topic - and I&amp;rsquo;m sure that they are all super great!</description>
